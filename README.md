In this project, I will deconstruct Google's homepage and rebuild it. I will build the page's code from scratch and work extensively with Firefox's developer tools for assistance and accuracy.

I will demonstrate utilizing and modifying HTML and CSS code within developer tools as well as a working knowledge of both languages. I will display my ability to work with positioning, colors, background colors, images, links, aligning elements, borders, box shadows, inline CSS code, internal CSS code, external CSS code, classes, IDs, and basic forms.
